You are required to create a Payroll application for the Serhant Construction Company. The company collects the number of hours worked per employee and generate a Payroll for the employee and save the information to a database.

NOTE: Some employees may work overtime. The system should calculate the necessary overtime based on the department the employee works in. The departments are Operations, Sales & Marketing, Administration and Accounts

Attention must be made to allowing the Accounts Staff to be able to:

Retrieve entered salary information entered by supervisors (A message or meaningful indicator should be displayed if information is missing.)

Retrieve an employee's salary information given a Pay Cycle or a Date Range (Ranges should give a summary information over the date range - Using Aggregate Functions)

Add/Edit Salary information for the employee COMPLETED;

Generate a Payslip for the employee

Employees should also be able to:
Login to the application and pull up their salary information for a particular pay cycle

Supervisors should be able to :-
Generate a Salary Summary for the department
Create/Edit an employee in their department and add their basic salary information
Add/Edit Overtime hours worked for the employees in their department
Enter Sick or absent dates for an employee. Absent or sick days are not paid but need to be entered in the system
